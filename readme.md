 # MonDiabetes
An open-source non-deployed mobile application for monitoring diabetics built using React Native and Firebase

  `The application was made in french language
`
> Created by : Mohamed El Amine Chafiki & Ouijdan Addou
> Purpose : End of Study (Bachelor) Project

## 1. Why did we create this application ?

For monitoring diabetes, the patient needs to make an appointment to see the doctor. And the latter himself has difficulties in monitoring and communicating with his patients. For this, we have created this mobile application which will fix the following problems:

Patient does not record blood glucose readings;
The patient does not measure his blood sugar regularly (forgetting);
The patient does not monitor his health (nutrition, sport) regularly;
The patient has difficulty moving around.
The doctor finds it difficult to manage and contact all his patients.

## 2. Solution
### 2.1. Our application will allow to:
#### 2.1.1. For the patient :
Allow easy access to information
The patient easily enters his data (meals, blood sugar, physical activities, insulin intake) for complete monitoring
Remind the patient of his treatment, the dosage.
Allow the patient to document their blood glucose levels, insulin doses injected, physical activity data, carbohydrate servings and other data related to their diabetes
Display messages to the patient, examples: not to forget their treatment or their blood sugar level if the application has not received an order for 2 days
Display messages relating to omissions of data entered Display statistics / graphs
Allow the patient to contact their doctor at any time

#### 2.1.2. For the doctor :
Allow him to manage these patients
Allow him to contact these patients

### 2.2. Specifications
Our IS "Design and realization of a mobile application for the follow-up of diabetics" will make it possible to follow the sugar level, the pressure, the insulin index reminder on a regular basis...

### 2.3. Design methodology
Allows to give an architecture to the software by giving the definition of the interfaces and interactions between components, their role.

### 2.4. Overiew on the application architecture

## 3. Conclusion
A Description of the project framework and design method UML events are used as a modeling language. We then established a preliminary study to identify the different participants to interact with the system to be produced, then standardize the functional requirements via use case diagrams and a requirements analysis using sequence diagrams once the function of the determined system, we introduce the design of our application. Concretely, the class diagram, then the database obtained by applying the rules for transferring class diagrams to the relational model.

**Finally, the mobile development tools and languages we used to implement our application**
